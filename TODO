DONE:Calculate F3 Zavg
    Zfile = (with best Betas) Enative + Eavg of decoys / Esd of decoys

DONE:Roulette wheel population crossover

refactor GA engine to be a function we can run
run all models (so only loading data once)

parameterize Population, Crossover / Elite % - 


F1 - PCC - calculate per file and you average them
Zscore - per file avg across everything

Zscore native - eAvg = np.mean(TMScore) eSD = np.std(TMScore)
